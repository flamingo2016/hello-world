Included in the Japanese Godzilla series back in the 1950s, Mechagodzilla was created by the Simians, a race of humanoid apes, in order to achieve world domination. It first appeared in the series disguising itself as Godzilla and destroyed cities. Because of its advanced weaponry and technology, its many weapons, including that of Godzilla’s atomic breath, proved to be the King of Beast’s most formidable foe.
